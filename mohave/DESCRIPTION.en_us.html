<p>Mohave is a titling display typeface, built with smooth height and dynamic glyphs. This typeface is designed for large point size setting and contains four weights. The letterforms are nearly monolinear, with fewer corrections applied to stroke and joints to maintain the typefaces structure remain visible. The new version has new body shapes, with more neutral and modulated forms, including some alternates in the uppercase and lowercase and equipped with OpenType Pro encoding. <a href="http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar">Huerta Tipogr√°fica</a>.</p>
